    "\n",
    "In this step, you will create a retriever to query the vector store and fetch the most relevant text chunks for a given input query. The retriever uses the vector embeddings to perform similarity-based searches.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Instructions:\n",
    "1. **Create the Retriever:**\n",
    "   - Use the `as_retriever` method on the `vector_store` to create a retriever.\n",
    "   - Set the `search_type` parameter to `\"mmr\"` (Maximal Marginal Relevance) to ensure diverse and relevant retrieval.\n",
    "   - Pass additional search settings using `search_kwargs`, such as:\n",
    "     - **`k`:** The number of chunks to retrieve (e.g., `k=3`).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Assign the Retriever:**\n",
    "   - Store the retriever in the variable `retriever` for later use in querying the vector store.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Verify the Retriever:**\n",
    "   - Ensure the retriever is correctly initialized and ready to handle queries.\n",

    "### Task: Build a RAG Model Function\n",
    "\n",
    "In this task, you will combine all the steps from the previous tasks to create a reusable function for building a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model. The function will process raw text documents, generate embeddings, and store them in a vector store for efficient retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What You Need to Do:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Define the Function:**\n",
    "   - Create a function named `build_rag_model` with the following parameters:\n",
    "     - **`texts` (List[str]):** A list of raw documents or text strings to process.\n",
    "     - **`embedding_model` (str):** The name of the Hugging Face embedding model to use.\n",
    "     - **`chunk_size` (int):** The maximum size of each text chunk.\n",
    "     - **`chunk_overlap` (int):** The overlap size between consecutive chunks.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Implement the Steps:**\n",
    "   - **Step 1:** **Split Text into Chunks**\n",
    "     - Use `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` to split the provided `texts` into chunks.\n",
    "     - Ensure the function handles all documents in the list and combines the resulting chunks.\n",
    "     - Print the number of generated chunks for debugging purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Step 2:** **Generate Embeddings**\n",
    "     - Initialize a `HuggingFaceEmbeddings` object using the provided `embedding_model`.\n",
    "     - Use this object to generate embeddings for the text chunks.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Step 3:** **Create a Vector Store**\n",
    "     - Use `Chroma.from_texts` to create a vector store from the chunks and their embeddings.\n",
    "     - Print the number of chunks stored in the vector store for confirmation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Return the Vector Store:**\n",
    "   - The function should return the vector store so it can be used for retrieval tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example Usage:\n",
    "- Call the function like this:\n",

    "\n",
    "In this task, you will define and initialize a generative model that can answer user questions based on a given context. This involves creating a prompt template, setting up an output parser, and initializing the language model for generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What You Need to Do:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Define the Prompt Template:**\n",
    "   - Use the `PromptTemplate` class to define a template that specifies how user questions and the associated context are structured.\n",
    "   - Your template should:\n",
    "     - Include placeholders for the context (`{context}`) and question (`{question}`).\n",
    "     - Provide clear instructions for the model to generate answers based only on the context.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Initialize the Prompt Template:**\n",
    "   - Set the `template` argument to the system template:\n",
    "   - Specify the `input_variables` as `[\"context\", \"question\"]` to define the placeholders.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Set Up the Output Parser:**\n",
    "   - Use the `StrOutputParser` to parse the string output from the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Initialize the Generative Model:**\n",
    "   - Use the `ChatGroq` class to set up a generative model with the following parameters:\n",
    "     - **`model`:** Specify the model name (e.g., `\"llama-3.2-3b-preview\"`).\n",
    "     - **`temperature`:** Set to `0` for deterministic outputs.\n",
    "     - **`max_tokens`:** Set to `None` to allow the model to decide the output length.\n",
    "     - **`timeout`:** Set to handle timeouts during generation.\n",
    "     - **`max_retries`:** Define the number of retries in case of failure.\n",

    "     - **`question`:** The generated question.\n",
    "     - **`answer`:** The corresponding answer.\n",

    "     - **`groundedness_score` >= 4:** The question is well-anchored in the provided context.\n",
    "     - **`standalone_score` >= 4:** The question is clear and understandable without additional context.\n",

    "### Explanation: Running the Complete RAG Evaluation Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "This script integrates all the steps covered so far to run a full evaluation of the RAG system across different configurations. It includes embedding creation, chunking, retrieval, generation, and evaluation in a loop to test multiple setups.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step-by-Step Breakdown:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create Output Directory:**\n",
    "   - Ensures that a directory named `./output` exists to store the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Define Configurations:**\n",
    "   - **`embedding_models`:** List of embedding models to test (e.g., `\"sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2\"`).\n",
    "   - **`chunk_sizes`:** List of `(chunk_size, overlap)` tuples to test different chunking strategies.\n",
    "     - Example:\n",
    "       - `[2000, 100]`: Chunks of 2000 characters with 100-character overlap.\n",
    "       - `[5000, 500]`: Larger chunks of 5000 characters with 500-character overlap.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Iterate Over Configurations:**\n",
    "   - Loops through all combinations of `embedding_models` and `chunk_sizes`.\n",
    "   - Constructs a unique `settings_name` for each combination to name the output files clearly.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Build the Knowledge Base:**\n",
    "   - Calls the `build_rag_model` function with:\n",
    "     - `texts`: The input data (e.g., pre-split chunks of the documents).\n",
    "     - `embedding_model`: The current embedding model.\n",
    "     - `chunk_size` and `chunk_overlap`: Parameters for splitting the text.\n",
    "   - Converts the resulting vector store into a retriever (`knowledge_index`) for querying.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Run the RAG System:**\n",
    "   - Iterates through the `eval_dataset` (assumed to contain questions and true answers).\n",
    "   - Calls the `answer_with_rag` function to:\n",
    "     - Retrieve relevant documents using the `knowledge_index`.\n",
    "     - Generate answers using the RAG chain (`rag_chain`).\n",
    "   - Appends the results to a list, including:\n",
    "     - The question, true answer, generated answer, and retrieved documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Save Results:**\n",
    "   - Saves the answers to a JSON file named based on the configuration (`output_file_name`).\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Evaluate the Answers:**\n",
    "   - Calls `evaluate_answers` to:\n",
    "     - Critique and score the generated answers using the LLM evaluator (`eval_chat_model`).\n",
    "     - Update the saved results with scores and feedback for each answer.\n",

    "   - Automates the entire RAG pipeline, from embedding creation to evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Flexible Testing:**\n",
    "   - Tests multiple configurations for embeddings and chunking, enabling comparative analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Results Storage:**\n",
    "   - Saves intermediate and final results to disk for reproducibility and further analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Scoring and Feedback:**\n",
    "   - Generates actionable feedback and numerical scores for the generated answers.\n",
